1. Introduction
===============

Thank you for using "PageCache powered by Varnish" (PageCache) module.
This package contains everything you need to connect Varnish Cache with your 
Magento Commerce shop and to get the most out of Varnish’s powerful
caching capabilities for a blazing fast eCommerce site.

The PageCache module has been architectural certified by Varnish
Software to ensure highest quality and reliability for Magento stores.
PHOENIX MEDIA is a Varnish Integration Partner and Magento Gold Partner
in Germany and Austria and is maintaining this module as well as providing
professional services for Varnish and Magento Commerce.

The PageCache module consists of two main components:
- The Magento module and
- the bundled Varnish Cache configuration file (VCL).
The PageCache module basically sets the correct Cache-Control headers
according to the configuration and the visitor session and provides
an interface for cleaning Varnish’s cache.
The second component, the VCL, configures Varnish to process the client requests
and Magento’s HTML response according to the Cache-Control headers
the PageCache module adds to every response.

Beside shop pages Varnish will also cache static content that is
served by the web server like product images, CSS or JavaScript files
or even flash or PDF resources. While you can also clean Varnish’s
static content cache from the Magento Cache Management page the
PageCache configuration won’t affect any of the static file’s HTTP
headers as they are directly served by the web server.


2. Prerequisites
================

Before installing the PageCache module you should setup a test hosting
environment as you will need to change the web server’s port
configuration and put Varnish in front which will certainly take a while
for configuring and testing. If you directly rollout this solution to
your production server you will certainly have down times which should
be prevented to not annoy your customers.

Ensure that your Magento Commerce shop is running without any problems
in your environment as debugging Magento issues with a proxy like
Varnish in front might be difficult.

PageCache supports Magento Community Edition from version 1.5.1
and Magento Professional/Enterprise Edition from version 1.9.0 on.

Furthermore you should have installed Varnish >= 3.0 on your Linux
server. To install Varnish Cache refer to the excellent documentation at
http://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/ where you will also find lots of
information about VCL (Varnish Configuration Language), the heart of Varnish.
If you need professional service for setup your server please contact
Varnish Software for commercial support for the Varnish Cache software.
Check out their website or send them a mail at sales@varnish-software.com.


3. Installation
===============

The installation of the Magento module is pretty easy:

1. Copy the contents of the app directory in the archive to the app
   directory of your Magento instance.
2. Go to the Magento backend and open the Cache Management (System ->
   Cache Management) and refresh the configuration and layout cache.

If any critical issue occurs you can’t easily solve, go to
app/etc/modules, open "Phoenix_VarnishCache.xml" and set "false" in the
"active" tag to deactivate the PageCache module. If necessary
clear Magento’s cache again.

As Varnish is already installed on your server you should just make a
backup of your default.vcl file which is shipped with Varnish. It should
be located at /etc/varnish/default.vcl. Copy the VCL file bundled with
the PageCache module for your version of Varnish (located at 
app/code/local/Phoenix/VarnishCache/etc/default*.vcl) to your Varnish
configuration directory (/etc/varnish/). If you subscribed to the Enterprise Edition
of the module you find and improved VCL file with ESI support (see section 4.4) here:
app/code/local/Phoenix/VarnishCacheEnterprise/etc/esi_3.0.vcl.

In case you use EE >= 1.13 or CE >= 1.8 and you want to make use of frontend
form keys you have to enable ESI within varnish.
Make sure you copy the file vars.vcl to the Varnish configuration directory
as well. It should be located in the same directory as the default.vcl.

We also recommend you check Varnish's startup parameters. Depending on your OS the
location of your startup settings might differ. For RHEL/CentOS e.g. you find it under
/etc/sysconfig/varnish.
To make ESI run smoothly add this startup parameters:

-p esi_syntax=0x03
to make varnish not yell at you cause of "no valid XML" 

-p shm_reclen=4096
to maximize the length for GET requests - 4K should be fair enough.
if this is too short - varnish will truncate your request.


Do not restart the Varnish service until you have checked the new VCL
file to adjust your hosting specific values (at least backends and purge
ACLs).

Proceed with the configuration.


4. Configuration
================

This section handles the differnet configuration option for the module
as well as settings that have to be done on the server side.

4.1 PageCache module
====================

In your Magento backend go to System -> Configuration -> "PageCache
powered by Varnish Enterprise" and open "General Settings" tab.

In the following section the configuration options for the PageCache
powered by Varnish module are explained. Most of them can be changed on
website and store view level which allows fine granulated configurations
for different store frontends.
Note that if you change a value here Varnish will not reflect it until
you purge its HTML objects or the TTL of the cached objects expires.

Enable cache module
-------------------
This enables the basic functionality like setting HTTP headers and
allows cache cleaning on the Magento Cache Management page. This option
should be set to "Yes" globally even if you like to deactivate the
module for certain websites or store views. Otherwise the cleaning
options on the Cache Magement page won’t be available.

Varnish servers
---------------
Add your Varnish server(s) domains or IPs separated by semicolon.

Server port
-----------
The port your Varnish servers listens on.
This port is used for all servers in your server list.

Admin Server port
-----------------
The port your Varnish servers telnet listens to.
This port is used for all servers in your server list.

Admin server secret
----------------------------
Secret string for CLI authentication.
This file is used for all servers in your server list.

Disable caching
---------------
This option allows you to deactivate caching of every Magento frontend
page in Varnish. This is useful for development or tests by passing all
requests through Varnish without caching them. If you have a staging
website within your Magento Enterprise instance make sure this option is
set to "Yes" for this website.
Technically Varnish will still be active but every request gets a TTL of 0.

Disable caching for routes
--------------------------
Certain controllers or actions within Magento must not be cached by
Varnish as their response surely contains custom data or it is necessary
to process a request in database (API calls, payment callbacks).
Although Varnish passes all POST requests (which most often are used to
submit forms with custom information etc.) you can also define the
controllers and actions that should have the "no-cache" flag in their
HTTP response header.
Note: The function relies on 
Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Action::getFullActionName().

Disable caching vars
--------------------
Some GET variables in the frontend will not only change a single page
but will be stored in the visitor session and change the output of all
following request that might not have this GET parameter. For example a
store view, language or currency switch will only pass the parameter
once to Magento to change the output and all following requests will not
contain this parameter in the URL as the information is taken from the
visitor’s session.
As Varnish is not session aware it can handle only one content per
domain + URL combination. To prevent any conflicts with this behavior
the PageCache module will set a NO_CACHE cookie to the response to pass
all following request by this client through Varnish and let Magento
handle the request directly.

Default cache TTL
-----------------
Varnish delivers cached objects without requesting the web server or
Magento again for a certain period of time defined in the TTL (time to
live) value. You can adjust the TTL for your shop pages on store view
level which allows you to have different TTLs for your frontend pages.
Note that this field only allows numeric values in seconds. It doesn’t
support the same notation that can be used in the VCL. "2h" (2
hours) have to be entered as "7200" seconds.
For static contents Varnish uses the default TTL value defined in the 
vcl_fetch section of the VCL (Default: set beresp.ttl = 4h).

Cache TTL for routes
---------------------
This options allows you to adjust Varnish cache TTL on a per magento 
controllers/actions basis. To add a new TTL value for route
1) click "Add route" button
2) input route (e.g. "cms", "catalog_product_view");
3) input TTL for route in seconds (e.g. "7200").
"Default Cache TTL"  value is used when no TTL for a given route is defined.

Export VCL File
---------------
When clicked this button, PageCache module reads VCL loaded to RAM, 
updates it according to Magento Design Exceptions configurations and
serves VCL file for download. Varnish servers should be restarted using
this file to changes take place.

Purge category
--------------
This option binds automatic purge of category (Varnish) cache with its
update event. If you always want up-to-date category information on 
front-end set the option value to "Yes" and category cache will be 
invalidated each time a category update occurs.

Purge product
--------------
This option binds purge of product (Varnish) cache with product and 
product's stock update. If set to "Yes" product pages cache is 
invalidated each time product update or product's stock update occurs.
Additionally, if "Purge Category" option is set to "Yes" this triggers 
product's categories cache purge on product/product stock update.
This option is useful to keep product pages and categories up-to-date
when product becomes out of stock (i.e. when the last item purchased by
a customer).

Purge CMS page
--------------
This option binds automatic purge of CMS page (Varnish) cache with its
update event. If set to "Yes" CMS page cache is invalidated each time
CMS page update event occurs (i.e. CMS page content update via Magento
admin).

Debug
-----
The PageCache module adds several HTTP headers to let Varnish know what
to do with the Magento response. Also Varnish adds several tags in the
HTTP headers to pass information to the client to allow debugging of
requests directly in the browser. However this information should be
removed in production environments which can easily be done by setting
this value to "No".

Beside the HTTP headers the PageCache module can also log purge requests
to /var/log/varnish_cache.log if the developer log (System ->
Configuration -> Developer) is enabled. The log file will allow you to
see which PURGE requests have been sent to Varnish.

4.2 Varnish Cache (VCL)
=======================

PageCache ships with a ready-to-go VCL file that let Magento and Varnish
play nicely together. Although the VCL should be sufficient to start with
Magento and Varnish right away you can of course adjust it to your needs
if necessary. Please see VCL documentation at
http://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/reference/vcl.html.

In the "etc" subdirectory you can find different vcl files:
- default_3.0.vcl
- vars.vcl
or with the Enterprise Edition:
- esi_3.0.vcl
- esi_geo.vcl (if you want to use the geoip feature)
- vars.vcl

You have to copy all the needed vcl files to your varnish config directory.

When putting Varnish in front of your web server (backend) you will have
to change the web server’s port which is normally port 80. We recommend
to change its’ listen port to 8080 which is already configured in the
VCL. If your Varnish server doesn’t run on the same server as your web
server (backend) you need to adjust the default backend at the beginning
of the VCL file. Also you will have to adjust the purge ACL below to
allow the purge requests which are triggered from the Magento backend
which have the IP of your web server (backend).

We also recommend adjusting the vcl_error section which will be echoed
if the backend (Magento) is not available.

As special feature Varnish’s saint mode has been enabled in the
vcl_fetch section by default, which allows Varnish to deliver content
even if an object is expired when your backend is unreachable to refresh
it. With this feature your uptime and availability will be increased for
better customer experience.

Beside the VCL don't forget to check Varnish's startup parameters. They
allow fine tuning of timeouts, cache size, location of the VCL file and
much more. Checkout Varnish Cache documentation for details.

4.3 PageCache Crawler (Enterprise Edition only)
===============================================

PageCache Crawler allows to maintain up-to-date store's cache. It runs by
cron making PageCache module generate cache for crawled pages. Therefore,
when a page is visited for the first time its contents delivered from cache
rather than backend.

For configuration, in your Magento backend go to System -> Configuration ->
"PageCache powered by Varnish Enterprise" and open the "Crawler Settings" tab.

Enable Page Cache Auto Generation
---------------------------------
Enables the PageCache Crawler module. Please, note that "Cron Expression for
Crawler" should contain a valid cron expression, otherwise crawler won't run.

Generate Cache for all Currencies
---------------------------------
If set to "Yes" cache will be generated for pages with all available currencies
rather than default currency only.

Crawler Thread Number
---------------------
The number of requests the crawler process runs in parallel.

Cron Expression for Crawler
---------------------------
Defines cron run schedule. This field should contain a valid cron expression
string like "0 0 * * *" for daily run or "0 * * * *" for hourly run. For more
information read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

4.4 ESI
=======

Edge Side Includes (ESI) is implemented in Varnish as a subset of the W3C
definition (http://www.w3.org/TR/esi-lang) and supports esi:include and 
esi:remove only.
With ESI enabled your Magento installation will become even faster than running
only Varnish alone. ESI is used to cache recurring snippets (aka blocks in Magento)
and reuse them in different pages.
To make ESI play nicely with Magento we provide you with a custom VCL file that
is found in app/code/local/Phoenix/VarnishCacheEnterprise/etc/esi_3.0.vcl
All basic setup steps for the default.vcl bundled with PageCache apply for the
enterprise VCL.
Please note that the Page Cache shipped with Magento Enterprise Edition is not
compatible with ESI and therefore has to be turned of (System -> Cache Management)
as it is based on the same application logic (replacing original blocks with
placeholders and compile the actual page content on the fly).

4.4.1 Form Key Handling
-----------------------
As with version CE 1.8 and EE 1.13 Magento introduced form keys in the frontend.
In case you want to use version that uses form keys you have to make sure ESI is
turned on in your Varnish configuration (see chapter 3) and that the vars.vcl
file is in the correct location (typically /etc/varnish/).

4.4.2 Enterprise Edition Features
---------------------------------

The enterprise version comes preconfigured with ESI handling for these blocks:
- top links
- welcome message
- sidebar/mini cart
- recently viewed products
- recently compared products
- wishlist

To enable ESI functionality go to System -> Configuration -> "PageCache powered by
Varnish Enterprise" and open the "ESI Settings" tab and choose "Yes" with
"Enable ESI".
Magento Enterprise users need to make sure that the "Page Cache" in System -> Cache
Management is disabled before enabling ESI.

Default ESI TTL
---------------
The default TTL for ESI blocks in seconds. This applies for blocks that have no specific
value in the next section.

ESI TTL for blocks
------------------
You can override the default TTL by setting block specific values.
The block name must match the tag names defined in the config.xml in 
app/code/local/Phoenix/VarnishCacheEnterprise/etc in the <varnishenterprise_esi_tags>
section.

ESI Strict Rendering
--------------------
When set to "No" block logic gets simplified to get better hit rates. However the content might slightly
differ from native Magento block. This affects especially to the "recently viewed products" and "recently compared
products" block which natively filters the list of viewed or compared products.

Disable ESI on secure requests
------------------------------
Secure requests can be problematic as ESI processing with Varnish requires SSL offloading. Leave this option to "yes" to
disable ESI blocks for secure requests.
If your web server (Apache, NginX) listens on port 443 (HTTPS/SSL) Varnish will not be able to process the ESI tags and
the blocks would be empty. If this option is set to "yes" the module will deactivate ESI functionality for secure
requests. If you are using SSL offloading (e.g. by a load balancer or NginX infront of the Varnish server) you can set
this option to "no".
Note that some blocks (e.g. last viewed products) won't work correctly when ESI blocks are disabled on secure requests.

ESI Debug
---------
Enables markers to identify ESI blocks in the frontend. It will also echo the internal
ESI URL per block for debugging. Use this only in a test environment.

ESI Passthrough
---------------
Pass all ESI requests through Varnish to the backend without caching them. This is a shortcut to set the TTL of ESI
blocks temporarily to 0 seconds.

4.5 GeoIP handling (Enterprise Edition only)
=================================

GeoIP handling will get the country of a web client based on it's IP address.
This feature can be used to either automatically redirect customers to the store matching their
country or to show them a dialog to select the desired store themselves.

prerequisites
------------
You have to install the MaxMind GeoIP database alongside your varnish server. You can get it here
http://www.maxmind.com/de/geolocation_landing or install it with your usual Linux package system.
As the vcl configuration that comes with this module is based on the MaxMind c-api, only this library is supported.

On most Linux package managements the libraries are called: GeoIP and GeoIP-devel.

To make use of then GeoIP handling ESI has to be enabled.
To enable GeoIP handling go to System -> Configuration -> "PageCache powered by Varnish Enterprise"
and open the "GeoIP Settings" tab and choose "Yes" with "Enable GeoIP".
Make sure to be on store configuration scope.

varnish start parameters
------------------------
To make Varnish use the GeoIP library add the following parameter to the options when starting varnishd
-p 'cc_command=exec cc -fpic -shared -Wl,-x -o %o %s -lGeoIP'

general behaviour
-----------------
The module will set a cookie with the name "pagegache-geoip-processed" after a redirect or when a dialog is displayed.
If this cookie is set on the customer side this module will take no action at all as we presume the customer either
saw (and maybe interacted with) the popup or was automatically redirected to the matching store.

Show a dialog to select target store
------------------------------------
When set to "yes" your customers will be presented with a dialog. When set to "no" your customers will be redirected.
The action performed depends on two variables:
- the current store
- the country of your customer
To configure the dialog or the redirect url you have to switch to store scope and add mappings for the countries you
want to redirect/inform.
All country mappings use ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 codes.

Mapping for static CMS blocks
-----------------------------
For every country you want to show a dialog you have to enter a country code an select a static cms block to display.
This module comes with predefined cms blocks to be a base for your custom development.
The modal window itself can be customized by editing the template file under
/frontend/base/default/template/varnishcacheenterprise/page/geoipdialog.phtml

Mapping for redirects
---------------------
For every country you want to redirect to a specific store you have to enter a country code an select a target store.

Prevent redirect or static blocks to be shown
---------------------------------------------
You probably don't want to redirect your customers to another store if the country of your visitor matches the current
store.
To prevent redirects you have to add a mapping using the country code of that store and leave the other field empty.
This way, if your customer is in the "right" store (based on the country) no geoip based action will be triggered.


5. Cache cleaning, PURGE requests
=================================

Varnish caches objects for a certain period of time according to their
TTL. After that the object will not be requested from the web server or
Magento again. Until the TTL expires Varnish will deliver the cached
object no matter what will change within Magento or the webserver’s file
system. To force Varnish to cleanup its’ cache and to retrieve the
information again from the backend you can trigger a purge/ban requests
right from Magento.

In the Magento backend go to System -> Cache Management. If you have
enabled the PageCache module in the configuration you will see a new
button "Clean Varnish Cache" in the "Additional Cache Management"
section. You can purge all objects in Varnish Cache by just clicking
"Clean Varnish Cache" or define which store view and/or content type
should be purged. For the store views PageCache will look up the
configured domains in System -> Configuration -> Web and pass the
domain(s) of the selected store view as an argument of the purge request
to Varnish. This will allow you for example to remove the CSS files of a
certain store view in Varnish if they have been modified without the
need to invalidate any other object which will save a lot of resources
on high frequented stores.

It is also possible to purge a single url (e.g. page) using "Quick Purge".
Enter desired URL in input field next to "Quick Purge" button and press
it. If URL is valid you'll see a success message for purged page.

Beside these direct purge requests PageCache has observers for "Flush
Magento Cache" and "Flush Cache Storage" to purge all objects in Varnish
together with the Magento cache refresh. It also has observers for
"Flush Catalog Images Cache" and "Flush JavaScript/CSS Cache" to clean
objects that match the appropriate URL path in Varnish. All HTML objects
will be purged too as the product image and JavaScript/CSS paths will
change when Magento generated them again so the cached HTML objects
might contain wrong paths if not refreshed.
You can also enable automatic purging of CMS pages, categories and products
when they are saved (see configuration). 
If you don’t want these observers to take automatic action comment them
out in the config.xml of the PageCache module.


6. VCL Design Exceptions
========================

By default Varnish does not take into account User-Agent string of a request
when building its cache object. Magento Design Exceptions use regular
expressions to match different design configurations to User-Agent strings.
In order to make Design Exceptions work with Varnish you will have to renew
Varnish VCL each time Design Exceptions are updated. Here's what you have to
do:
In your Magento backend go to System -> Configuration -> "PageCache powered by
Varnish Enterprise" and open "General Settings" tab.
Press "Export VCL" button.
Your browser should start file download your server VCL updated with design
exceptions subroutine. Restart your varnish servers using downloaded VCL.

You can run "man varnishd" in command line for description of varnishd options.
Also see documentation explaining how to start varnish for versions 3.0 respectively: 
https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/tutorial/starting_varnish.html


7. Troubleshooting
==================

7.1 Known issues
================

- "Use SID in Frontend" in System Configuration->Web->Session Validation Settings
must not be set to "yes" otherwise a GET parameter ___SID will be added
which disables caching at all.
- "Redirect to CMS-page if Cookies are Disabled" in System Configuration->Web->
Browser Capabilities Detection must be turned off as visitors served by Varnish
won't get a cookie until they put something in the cart of login.
- Logging and statistics will be fragmentary (Varnish won't pass cached
requests to the webserver or Magento). Instead make use of a JavaScript
based statistics like Google Analytics or contact Varnish Software who
offers additional tools for that as part of their subscription services.
- Running FPC (Magento Enterprise Full Page Cache) along with ESI will result in
ESI not displaying any cached blocks. To use Varnish ESI with Magento Enterprise
you have to disable FPC completely.

7.2 Prevent caching for custom modules
======================================

In your Magento installation you will surely have custom modules whose
HTML output shouldn’t be cached. Therefore you have two options: Either
add their controllers to the "Disable caching for routes" configuration
to prevent caching of their output. Or, if your module changes the
visitor session for all following request, dispatch an event in your
Magento module and add an observer to let PageCache set a NO_CACHE
cookie (compare config.xml):

<catalog_product_compare_add_product>
    <observers>
        <varnishcache>
            <class>varnishcache/observer</class>
            <method>disablePageCachingPermanent</method>
        </varnishcache>
    </observers>
</catalog_product_compare_add_product>

7.3 Prevent caching for HTML/PHP files outside Magento
======================================================

Varnish as a proxy respects caching information from the backend server like
"Cache-Control: max-age=600" or "Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 2021 08:52:00 GMT".
PageCache uses "Expires" to tell Varnish whether a Magento
page is cacheable and how long.
If you have mod_expires installed in your Apache and the Magento default setting
in your .htaccess 'ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"' this will allow Varnish
to cache every object outside of Magento (e.g. files in js, media or skin
folder) for one year.
However this also affects HTML or PHP files if they don't set their own
"Cache-Control" or "Expires" header. If you don't want HTML contents which don't
explicitly allow caching to be cached by Varnish, add this line to the
mod_expires section of your .htaccess file:

    ExpiresByType text/html A0
    
This will set the expiry time of the object equal to the delivery time which
will not allow Varnish to cache the object.

Note that if a "Expires" header is already set in the HTTP response header
mod_expires will respect it and pass this header without changes.

7.4 Debugging requests
======================

If Varnish does not behave like you expect there are some great tools
that will help you to analyze what’s going on. First you should activate
the debug mode in the PageCache module and purge the HTML objects in
System -> Cache Management to pass the full HTTP headers to your
browser.

A really great help for debugging requests is the "varnishlog" command
that is part of the Varnish distribution. You can call it on the shell
to show only HTML requests:
	varnishlog -c -o TxHeader "Content-Type: text/html" (Varnish 2.1)

Or of a certain URL:
	varnishlog -m RxURL:"^/blog" (Varnish 3.0)

You can also filter the output for a certain client IP:
	varnishlog -c -o ReqStart 123.456.78.9

If you still can’t solve the issues please contact
support@phoenix-media.eu to request professional services.

7.5 Vary HTTP header for User-Agent
===================================

Some administrators have this line in Magento's .htaccess file:

    # Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content
    Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary

However this forces Varnish Cache to have one cache element per user agent
string for each URL which makes caching almost useless. If you have the
feeling that in one browser your cache is hot while in a different
browser the Varnish has no cache hits check your backend response with
varnishlog and make sure the Vary header only looks like this:

    Vary: Accept-Encoding
